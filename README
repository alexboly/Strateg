A strategy game built using ATDD.

At least I will try to, since it's a pet project. I'm learning at the same time python and how to make a game, so it might not get too far.

To run the game you need python.

To run the acceptance tests, you will need lettuce.

This project is developed in Eclipse + pyDev.
